A Python library for the Mightex camera. 

This was specifically built to work with a BTN-B013U camera and implemented
from the “Mightex Buffer USB Camera USB Protocol”, v1.0.5. Also contains a
simple cross-platform viewer application demonstrating use of this API for
real-time image processing via PIL (that’s right, a working Mightex-to-PIL
Image converter: use mine so you don’t have to suffer the pain of figuring out
how to do this yourself).
