A Python library for the Mightex camera. 

This was specifically built to work with a BTN-B013U camera and implemented
from the “Mightex Buffer USB Camera USB Protocol”, v1.0.5. Also contains a
simple cross-platform viewer application demonstrating use of this API for
real-time image processing via PIL (that’s right, a working Mightex-to-PIL
Image converter: use mine so you don’t have to suffer the pain of figuring out
how to do this yourself).

Feel free to use this for whatever and however you like, though keep in mind I
sadly won't be able to provide you much support. Formally, all files may be
